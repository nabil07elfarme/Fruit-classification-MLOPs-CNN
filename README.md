# Fruit Classification MLOPs CNN


This project is a fruit classification system that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify different types of fruits. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) can be applied to build, deploy, and manage machine learning models effectively.

## Overview

The fruit classification model is trained using a CNN, a deep learning architecture well-suited for image classification tasks. The model is trained on a large dataset of fruit images, and it learns to distinguish between various types of fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, and more.

## Key Features

- **CNN Architecture**: The model is built using a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architecture, allowing it to learn intricate features from the fruit images.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to ensure uniformity and data quality, which is crucial for training an accurate and robust model.

- **MLOps Integration**: The project demonstrates the implementation of MLOps practices, enabling seamless model development, versioning, deployment, and monitoring.

- **Model Deployment**: The trained model is deployed using a cloud-based service, making it accessible for real-time predictions via APIs.
